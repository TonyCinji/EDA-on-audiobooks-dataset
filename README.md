# Introduction
With the trend toward audiobooks growing, I gathered this data to understand how the audiobook market has been growing over the years. From authors of audiobooks to release dates, the data represents the important details of audiobooks from 1998 till 2025 (pre-planned releases).

I have yet to find a great audiobooks dataset and hence the urge to make a dataset that provides us with information on the basics and the history of audiobooks. I look to improve the dataset with more details in the near future.
